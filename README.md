# SpaceShip_RBController
 
This is a project developed during my course of study, in which I was trying to emulate the movement of a spaceship, moving it, with its rigid body and rotating its orientation with the quaternion. Unity version 2020.1.6f1. 

# If you got any problem of packages, try to:

 - close unity
 - open the project folder 
 - delete the "Packages" folder
 - reopen the project.
 
This should fix the packages errors.

## Commands
- Player movements

  •) W, A, S, D. These buttons can be used to move the player in all directions, the longer it takes to press a button, the more speed you gain in the corresponding direction.
  
  •) Q, E. (Up and Down) These are the only 2 buttons used to move the player up and down from his head in the current position.
  
  •) Left Mouse Button for space ship rotation.
  
  •) Mouse wheel. Litte movement for the spaceship; ahead or back.
